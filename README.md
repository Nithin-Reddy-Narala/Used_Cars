# Used Cars

Used Cars is a project of Data Analytics Bootcamp.

## 1. Description

This project analyses the data of used cars and their prices with the rise in the variety of vehicles and features such as model, production year, category, brand, fuel type, mileage, cylinders, colour and many more. We all aspire to own a car within budget with the best features available.

I worked with an open-source dataset of used cars from Kaggle, containing information on various brands and prices.

## 2. Technologies used

The leading technologies used here are Python and Tableau Public. The raw data file is downloaded from Kaggle and imported into Jupyter Lab notebook using Pandas, cleaned_data.csv files exported & imported in Tableau for visualizations.

The Jupyter notebook includes Data cleaning & wrangling, Exploratory data analysis and hypothesis test based on the p-value.

## 3. Challenges

The main challenges throughout the project were to identify.  

Which type of car do you buy or suggest for someone?
  
  It is possible to identify which type of car is best by using exploratory analysis or tableau visualizations for the variables category, fuel type, cylinders, mileage etc., 
  
What were the prices of used cars for a particular brand or model?
  
  The relation between the brand, model, production year and the prices from the data set gives the cost of each car with their model in Tableau.
  
## 4. How to use
